# VHDL-MIPS-CPU 
## ðŸ““ Description
This project is a hardware implementation of a MIPS processor written in VHDL. It presents two types of architectures: single-cycle and pipeline. Fundamental CPU concepts are illustrated, including ALU operations, instruction decoding, and memory access.<br><br>

## Instruction set
The processor can execute three types of instructions: **`Register`**, **`Immediate`** and **`Jump`**.

**`Register-type`** instructions:
* add - Addition
* sub - Subtraction
* sll - Shift Left Logical
* srl - Shift Right Logical
* and - Logical AND
* or - Logical OR
* xor - Logical XOR
* slt - Set on Less Than<br><br>

**`Immediate-type`** instructions:
* addi - Add Immediate
* lw - Load Word
* sw - Store Word
* beq - Branch on Equal
* andi - AND Immediate
* slti - Set on Less Than Immediate<br><br>

**`Jump-type`** instructions:
* j - Jump<br><br>

The execution of an instruction consists of the following five stages:
1. IF â€“ Instruction Fetch
2. ID/OF â€“ Instruction Decode / Operand Fetch
3. EX â€“ Execute
4. MEM â€“ Memory
5. WB â€“ Write-Back
